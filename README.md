# Uncommon HTML Bug: Typo in getElementById

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug caused by a simple typo in JavaScript code interacting with an HTML element. The bug is related to the common task of manipulating the DOM (Document Object Model) using JavaScript.

## The Bug
The `bug.html` file contains a div element that should be hidden by JavaScript. However, due to a typo in the `getElementById` function, the div remains visible.

## The Solution
The `solution.html` file provides the corrected code, where the typo is fixed, successfully hiding the div element.

This example highlights the importance of careful coding and thorough testing, as even small errors can have significant consequences.
